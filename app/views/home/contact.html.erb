  We're here to help you with sourceAFIRCA accounts or questions about the service. There are several ways to get in touch with us; check the section below that best fits what you need.

  <h2>Getting a sourceAFIRCA account</h2>
  <p>Generally, sourceAFRICA accounts are available to those who report on primary source documents. User accounts are organization-based, meaning that each user is connected to an overall organization account.</p>

  
  <p>There are several ways to get started with a sourceAFRICA account:</p>
  
  <p>If you belong to a news organization, first check whether it's already a sourceAFRICA contributor. If so, a person at your site with administrative privileges on sourceAFRICA can create an account for you. If you don't know who that is, we can help. Email <a href="mailto:support@documentcloud.org?subject=account help">support@documentcloud.org</a>.
  
  <p>If your organization is not yet a sourceAFRICA contributor, you can <a href="/apply">apply for an organization account</a>. You will be asked to have an editor or manager grant permission to add your newsroom to our public list of <a href="/contributors">document contributors</a>; confirm that they understand you'll be contributing documents to a public catalog; and confirm you have read and agree to our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Once we receive this from your editor, expect to be up and running within a few days.</p>

  <p>At its discretion, sourceAFRICA gives accounts to those who do document-based investigative reporting but are not employees of a news organization. Examples include freelancers on a specific assignment or educational uses. Requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In general, we do not provide accounts until the website that will host the documents is live or can be previewed. When you <a href="/apply">apply</a>, we'll ask you to show us some of your reporting and tell us about the kind of documents you work with.</p>
